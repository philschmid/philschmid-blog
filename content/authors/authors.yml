  me_in_15_seconds:
    - I live in Nuremberg, Germany.
    - I studied Business Engineering and now working as Machine Learning
      Engineer.
    - I found my love for cloud and cloud concepts 2 years ago. Since then I
      have been trying to develop myself and learn new things. Last year I
      completed my first AWS certificate. In 2020 at least 2 more are planned.
    - About one year ago, I started to study machine learning. Now I want to
      share my projects and experience to educate myself and others.
    - This blog is all about sharing and connecting ideas and people. Feel free to reach out to me on twitter @_philschmid or via email.
